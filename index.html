                    <p>Infinity War pulls a few characters and trappings from the 2013 crossover comic Infinity, but it
                        owes much more to Infinity Gauntlet, the original story of Thanos, the Infinity Gems and the big
                        gold glove.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It is the story that made the Infinity Stones (or Gems, as theyâ€™re known in the comics) indelibly 
                        linked with Thanos and the Gauntlet, when the Mad Titan assembled all six and gained the ability 
                        to bend all of reality to his every whim.</p>

                    <h1>Scarecrow</h1>
                    <p>On the surface, this "Thanos-crow" symbolizes the fact that the Mad Titan has left his old life
                        behind. He no longer wants to be the feared tyrant who traveled from world to world and murdered
                        billions. He craves whatever sort of peace and contentment he can find after having sacrificed
                        his own children for his cause.</p>

                    <p>In the MCU, then, the worthiness enchantment is tied to a person's willingness to stand up for
                        others - no matter the cost. This is pretty much the same principle as the comics, where Mjolnir
                        has been lifted by a number of other key figures in the past, most notably Jane Foster.</p>
